## Idea

Bring conviniance of workflow known from tools like tmux to desktop gui.
Terminal is main utility, but additional components are planned for complete workflow: 

* Local and remote file manager. 
  By default each terminal will have one instance behind it with current location in sync between them.

* Monacco based text editor with linter and source code format tools.
  Will be capable of editing files directly from terminal and file manager.
